## Project about armories migration using data of the ATF
### Pedro Armengol

This project use the Listing of Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) published by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to track the armories* migration.
For this purpose, I filter the data to keep just the armories that changed of address in any of the following years: 2014,2015,2016 and 2017. 
I used snapshot of the data (June of each year) to observe the address of each year. Also, for "practical" purposes
I just keep those armories that change of address across states one or more times. 

Later on, a D3 visualization dynamic scatterplot was built to show the paths that the armories are followed over those years.
